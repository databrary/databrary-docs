health entity---grants permission for its Authorized Investigators,
identified below and in Annex II, (&quot;List of Authorized Investigators&quot;)
to access Databrary.</p> <p>Databrary is a web-based data library housed at New York University
designed for sharing behavioral data, including video files and
associated metadata. Authorized Investigators approved by their
Institutions for access to Databrary may access data shared by others
and/or contribute data for others to access. Databrary requires that an
Authorized Investigator secure Institutional approval, usually from a
research ethics board, before contributing personally identifiable human
or non-human animal data to Databrary or conducting research on any data
obtained from others through Databrary. Databrary, however, does not
require Institutional approval for permitted non-research uses (e.g.,
pre-research, preliminary analysis, self-study, teaching) beyond this
Databrary Access Agreement.</p> <p>All Institutions and Authorized Investigators agree to use Databrary and
data obtained through it exclusively for the purpose of non-commercial
scientific research or education.</p> <p>By signing this Databrary Access Agreement, the Institution verifies
that (a) it maintains or uses an ethics board or Institutional Review
Board with U.S.-equivalent standards that reviews and approves research
involving human subjects, (b) it reviews and approves research involving
non-human animal subjects, (c) its Authorized Investigators have
training that addresses research ethics with human subjects and/or
non-human animals, (d) its Authorized Investigators are eligible to
conduct independent research at the Institution, (e) its use of
Databrary will comply with this Databrary Access Agreement, and it
accepts responsibility for its Authorized Investigators' and other
employees' actions related to the use of Databrary, (f) it grants
Authorized Investigators the authority to choose and manage affiliates,
and (g) the person executing this Databrary Access Agreement on behalf
of the Institution has the authority to do so.</p> <p>The Institution and the Authorized Investigators agree that Databrary,
New York University, The Pennsylvania State University, and the relevant
funding agencies bear no responsibility for the use of Databrary or the
information contained within it. Except in cases where the Institution
is expressly prohibited by law from indemnifying third parties, the
Institution indemnifies and renders harmless Databrary, New York
University, and The Pennsylvania State University from all claims,
losses, liability, and other damages that arise from violations of this
Access Agreement by the Institution or the Institution's Authorized
Investigators. In cases where the Institution is prohibited by law from
indemnifying third parties, in accordance with and to the extent
permitted and limited by a superseding national, state, or local
provision, statute, or law, the Institution agrees that it will be
responsible for the payment of claims, including for loss, personal
injury, death, property damage, or otherwise, arising out of any act or
omission of its employees or agents in connection with the performance
of this agreement for which it is held liable under applicable law. It
is understood and agreed that this document shall constitute a separate
agreement between Databrary and the Institution, as amended from time to
time by the Institution and Databrary, to include additional Authorized
Investigators as listed in Annex II, to include new datasets available
to Authorized Investigators, and to expand the uses allowed for shared
datasets.</p> <p>By signing this Databrary Access Agreement, effective as of the date
entered below, the Institution and its Authorized Investigators
(optionally listed under Annex II) hereby agree to its terms, including
those found in the attached Annex I (&quot;Statement of Rights and
Responsibilities&quot;), and in the attached Annex III (&quot;Databrary Access
Guide&quot;). The Databrary Access Guide may be amended from time to time.
Databrary will notify the Institution and its Authorized Investigators
of any amendments to the Databrary Access Guide by email and will
maintain a copy on the Databrary website.</p> <h2 id="acknowledgement-by-authorized-investigator"><a href="#acknowledgement-by-authorized-investigator" class="header-anchor">#</a> Acknowledgement by Authorized Investigator</h2> <p>As an Authorized Investigator, I acknowledge that I have read and
