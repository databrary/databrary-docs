York University (&quot;NYU&quot;). Databrary is designed for the storage,
sharing, and re-use of Research Data, especially video and audio
recordings and associated Contents, some of which may contain personally
identifying or sensitive information about human or non-human animal
research participants. Some Contents on Databrary are available to any
User, but most Contents are accessible only to a restricted community of
Authorized Users who have approval from an Institution to browse,
stream, and download Contents and to upload, store, and share Contents
with other Authorized Users for educational, research, medical, or
charitable purposes.</p> <p>As used in this Privacy Policy, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;your&quot; include all individuals
accepting these policies as described below.</p> <p>We are committed to maintaining the highest level of privacy and
security in order to protect researchers and research participants. We
collect no information about you for commercial marketing or any other
purpose unrelated to our mission.</p> <ol start="2"><li>Definitions</li></ol> <hr> <p>We use the following defined terms:</p> <p><strong>Authorized Investigator</strong>: A person who has permission from an
Institution to conduct independent research and who has received
authorization from an Institution and from Databrary to access
Databrary.</p> <p><strong>Affiliate</strong>: A person who conducts research under an Authorized
Investigator's sponsorship and supervision and who has been granted
access to Databrary by the Authorized Investigator. In most cases,
Affiliates are students or research staff and are not eligible for
Authorized Investigator status.</p> <p><strong>Authorized Users</strong>: An Authorized Investigator or Affiliate who makes
use of our Websites.</p> <p><strong>Institution</strong>: An academic, not-for-profit, research, government, or
health entity whose employees or students conduct scientific research or
educational activities.</p> <p><strong>Content</strong>: Includes but is not limited to Data files, procedural
videos, videos of research participation, consent forms, participant
demographics, coding sheets, analysis scripts and output, comments,
tags, URLs, documents, and descriptive text.</p> <p><strong>Research Data</strong>: Content collected by scientific researchers about the
behavior or functioning of human or non-human animal participants for
the purpose of discovery and the advancement of human knowledge.</p> <p><strong>Identifiable Data</strong>: Collections of information that might be used
singly or in combination to determine the identity of research
participants or other individuals depicted in recordings or Research
Data.</p> <p><strong>Restricted Data</strong>: Research Data that is sensitive or contains
Identifiable Data and which requires that access be restricted to
specific individuals, namely Authorized Users.</p> <p><strong>Users</strong>: All persons, aged 18 years-of-age or older, who use our
Websites.</p> <p><strong>Websites</strong>: The websites maintained by Databrary, including
databrary.org, www.databrary.org, nyu.databrary.org, datavyu.org, and
www.datavyu.org.</p> <p><strong>Access Agreement</strong>: The Databrary Access Agreement between an
Authorized Investigator and his or her Institution and New York
University (NYU) on behalf of Databrary.</p> <ol start="3"><li>Consent</li></ol> <hr> <p>By using our Websites, you acknowledge and accept the privacy practices
described in this Privacy Policy. If you choose to publish personal
information on our Websites, it will be made available to other users.</p> <ol start="4"><li>Changes to this Privacy Policy</li></ol> <hr> <p>We may modify this Privacy Policy in whole or in part at any time. The
modified policy will be posted on our Websites with an updated effective
date. Please review any posted changes to our Privacy Policy carefully.
If you agree to the terms, simply continue to use our Websites. If you
object to any of the changes to our Privacy Policy, please do not
continue to access our Websites, as your continued use of our Websites
and Services after we have posted a notice of changes to the Privacy
Policy shall constitute your consent to the changed terms or practices.
Note that any personal data we collect about you is subject to the
Privacy Policy in effect at the time of its collection, and, further,
that you have certain rights with respect to that personal data, as
described in this Privacy Policy.</p> <ol start="5"><li>Content</li></ol> <hr> <p>Databrary's mission is to accelerate scientific discovery by
facilitating the storage, sharing, and re-use of Research Data,
including Restricted Data like video and audio recordings. Where
Restricted Data about humans are stored and shared, the permission of
research participants or the waiver of the requirement for that
permission by an Institution is required. This means that Authorized
Users can upload to Databrary research-related information (&quot;Content&quot;)
as permitted by their institutions, including, but not limited to, data
files, procedural videos, videos of research participation, consent
forms, participant demographics or characteristics, coding sheets, and
analysis scripts and output. In uploading or downloading Content,
Authorized Users agree to uphold the highest ethical standards, as laid
out in the Databrary Access Agreement
(https://www.databrary.org/resources/agreement.html). Ultimately,
Authorized Users are in control of both the nature of the Content stored
on Databrary, and with whom and to what extent that Content is shared,
within the bounds of what Research Data participants agreed to share and
what use has been authorized by the Authorized User's Institution.</p> <ol start="6"><li>Information Collected</li></ol> <hr> <h3 id="information-collected-from-users"><a href="#information-collected-from-users" class="header-anchor">#</a> Information Collected from Users</h3> <p>Unless you are a member of the general public with limited viewing
rights to Content, in order to fully use our Websites, you must register
and create an account that provides us with your name, institutional
email address, institution name, profile web page at your institution, a
password, and permission to contact your institution's appointed
contracts agent and related contact information in order to complete a
Databrary Access Agreement on your behalf.</p> <p>If you are authorized by your Institution to access to Databrary, either
as an Authorized Investigator or as an Affiliate, you will be asked to
enter your institutional email address (user ID) and Databrary password
for all subsequent access. In accessing Databrary as an Authorized User,
you agree to keep the information you have provided us (name, email,
institution) current and accurate. Your information may be modified by
accessing your user profile. If you choose to cancel your Databrary
access, you may delete your user account by emailing
<a href="mailto:contact@databrary.org">contact@databrary.org</a>.</p> <p>You may optionally provide a profile picture and your unique ORCID
(https://orcid.org/) identifier. If you choose to provide us with any
additional information about yourself, including through an e-mail
message, form, survey, etc., we will take every precaution to keep the
information confidential and protect your privacy to the extent
allowable by law.</p> <h4 id="how-we-use-the-information-collected-from-users"><a href="#how-we-use-the-information-collected-from-users" class="header-anchor">#</a> How We Use the Information Collected from Users</h4> <p>Your Databrary account will be used to organize, track, and label any
data you might choose to upload, as well as to track any Content you
download from our Website. This is done so that we can obtain aggregated
usage statistics and to identify the account responsible for any
breaches of the Databrary Access Agreement, Terms of Service, or this
Privacy Policy.</p> <p>We may periodically contact you via email to notify you of changes or
improvements in the Databrary website, to ask you for feedback on our
service, or to notify you of changes in Databrary's policies. In rare
cases, we may contact you with information related to a specific dataset
you have downloaded (e.g., if a participant or researcher has revoked
consent to share the data). You may opt out of automatic communications
in the Notifications section of your user profile.</p> <h3 id="information-collected-and-stored-automatically"><a href="#information-collected-and-stored-automatically" class="header-anchor">#</a> Information Collected and Stored Automatically</h3> <h4 id="log-files-and-ip-addresses"><a href="#log-files-and-ip-addresses" class="header-anchor">#</a> Log files and IP addresses</h4> <p>We may collect information from the devices and networks that you use to
visit our Websites in order to help improve the services we provide,
including the date and time of your visit, the operating system of your
computer or device, the version of the web browser or other program you
use, the Application Programming Interface (&quot;API&quot;) you use, your
mobile device carrier, your Internet Service Provider (&quot;ISP&quot;), and
your Internet Protocol Address (IP Address). An IP address is a number
that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the
Internet. For example, when you request a page from one of our sites,
our servers log your IP address to create aggregate reports on user
demographics, traffic patterns, and for purposes of system
administration. Every time you request or download a file from one of
our Websites, Databrary may store data about these events and your IP
address in a log file. We may use this information to analyze trends,
administer the site, track users' movements, and gather broad
demographic information for aggregate use or for other business
purposes. When you access or leave our Websites by clicking on a
hyperlink, we may receive the URL from the site from which you last
visited or the one to which you're directed. We also may receive
location data passed to us from third-party services or GPS-enabled
devices that you have set up in order to customize your experience based
on location information.</p> <h4 id="cookies"><a href="#cookies" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cookies</h4> <p>We use cookies and similar technologies, including mobile device
identifiers, to help us recognize you when you log into our Websites and
Services. By accessing our Websites, you are consenting to the placement
of cookies and other similar technologies in your browser in accordance
with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p> <p>Cookies are small packets of information that a site's computer stores
on your computer. Databrary can read the cookies whenever you visit our
Websites. We may use cookies in a number of ways, such as to save the
fact that you are logged into the system so you don't have to login in
each time you visit our Website, to deliver content specific to your
interests, and to track the pages you've visited. These cookies allow
us to use the information we collect to customize your experience so
that your visit to our Websites and your use of our Services are as
relevant and as valuable to you as possible. You may modify and control
how and when cookies are set through your browser settings. Most
browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to control or
reject cookies in the &quot;Help&quot; section of the toolbar. We do not link
non-personal information from cookies to personally identifiable
information without your permission.</p> <h4 id="web-beacons"><a href="#web-beacons" class="header-anchor">#</a> Web Beacons</h4> <p>Our Websites also may use web beacons and other technologies, such as
pixels and JavaScript tags, to collect non-personal information about
your use of our site and the sites you visit, your use of special
announcements or newsletters, and other activities. The information
collected by web beacons allows us, for example, to statistically
monitor how many people are using our Websites; how many people open our
emails; and for what purposes these actions are being taken.</p> <h4 id="google-analytics"><a href="#google-analytics" class="header-anchor">#</a> Google Analytics</h4> <p>Our sites use Google Analytics, a service which transmits website
traffic data to Google servers in the United States. Google Analytics
does not identify individual users or associate your IP address with any
other data held by Google. Google Analytics relies on cookies; a list of
the cookies used by Google Analytics can be found at

otherwise, no additional information will be collected about your use of
the Databrary website. We do not share personally identifiable
information with any third-party advertisers.</p> <ol start="7"><li>Contacting Databrary</li></ol> <hr> <p>If you contact Databrary, we collect information that helps us
categorize your question or report, respond to it, and, if applicable,
investigate any breach of this Privacy Policy. We also may use this
information to track potential problems and trends in order to improve
our services to you and to the community as a whole.</p> <ol start="8"><li>Disclosure</li></ol> <hr> <p>An Authorized Investigator who has shared Content on Databrary for use
by other Databrary users may request a list of those users who have
downloaded the Content. In that case, we will provide the person who
requested the list of users with your name and institution name. In no
other case will Databrary disclose, give, sell, or transfer any other
personal information about our visitors or users, unless required to do
so by law enforcement or by statute, or upon mutual agreement between
the relevant party and Databrary.</p> <ol start="9"><li>Third Party Sites</li></ol> <hr> <p>Databrary may link to external sites that are not controlled by NYU or
Databrary. Your use of such websites will be subject to the privacy
policies of those websites, which we encourage you to read. Databrary is
not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such
websites and does not make any representations about them.</p> <ol start="10"><li>Security</li></ol> <hr> <p>To ensure data and site security and continuous availability, we employ
software programs to monitor traffic and to identify unauthorized
attempts to upload, change information, download, or to otherwise cause
damage. We also periodically monitor our system for possible
vulnerabilities and attacks, consistent with industry standards. In the
event of authorized law enforcement investigations, and pursuant to any
required legal process, information from these sources may be used to
help identify an individual.</p> <p>You should be aware, however, that since the Internet is not a 100%
secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any
information that you submit to the site. There is also no guarantee that
information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by
breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It
is your responsibility to protect the security and integrity of your
account details, including your username and password. To maintain the
security of your information, you must keep your username(s) and
password(s) strictly confidential and not disclose them to anyone. You
will be solely responsible for any action, activities, and access to our
Websites that are taken using your username and password and that

active or as needed to comply with our legal obligations, even after
you've closed your account, such as to fulfill our obligations to our
others (including as described in Section 8), meet regulatory
requirements, resolve disputes between users, to prevent fraud and
abuse, or to enforce this Privacy Policy. We may be required to retain
personal information for a limited period of time if requested by law
enforcement. We also may retain indefinitely non-personally
identifiable, aggregate data to facilitate our ongoing operations.</p> <ol start="12"><li>Data transfer</li></ol> <hr> <p>Databrary may store and process personal information on servers or on a
cloud located outside of the country where you originally deposited
data. The data-protection laws of the country or countries where this
personal information will be stored or processed might not be as
comprehensive as those in your country. If you are unsure whether this
Privacy Policy is in conflict with applicable local rules, you should
not submit your information to Databrary. If you are located within the
European Economic Area (see 13. General Data Protection Regulation), you
should note that your information will be transferred to the United
States, which is deemed by the European Union to have inadequate data
protection. By using our Websites and/or directly providing personal
information to us, you hereby agree to and acknowledge your
understanding of the terms of this Privacy Policy, and consent to have
your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States
and/or in other jurisdictions as determined by Databrary,
notwithstanding your country of origin, or country, state, and/or
province of residence.</p> <ol start="13"><li>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</li></ol> <hr> <p>If you are a resident of or are located in the European Economic Area
(&quot;EEA&quot;), you may have certain rights under the General Data Protection
Regulation (&quot;GDPR&quot;). Personal data you provide is only collected with
your consent, and may be transmitted outside of the EEA to Databrary (or
computer servers maintained for the benefit of Databrary) pursuant to
that consent.</p> <p>In general, under the GDPR you may:</p> <ul><li><p>request access to your personal data.</p></li> <li><p>have incomplete or incorrect data corrected.</p></li> <li><p>have your personal data deleted.</p></li> <li><p>suspend or restrict our use of your personal data, or withdraw your
consent.</p></li> <li><p>request a copy of your personal data.</p></li> <li><p>complain to a supervisory authority if you believe your rights under
the GDPR are not being respected.</p></li></ul> <p>Should you request a copy of your personal data, we will supply to you a
copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of
charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.</p> <p>Should you request the deletion of your personal data, Databrary will
generally do so as soon as practicable, although your right to have your
personal data deleted is subject to exceptions, such as, for example,
compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or
defense of legal claims. If you consider that our processing of your
personal information infringes on data-protection laws, you have a legal
right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for
data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual
residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.</p> <p>Contact Databrary at <a href="mailto:support@databrary.org">support@databrary.org</a> if you have concerns
regarding your personal data, or wish to exercise any of these listed
rights.</p> <p>Note that, if you are in the EEA, we may transfer your personal data
outside of the EEA, including to the United States. By way of example,
this may happen if your personal data is transferred to our servers
located in a country outside of the EEA. These countries may not have
