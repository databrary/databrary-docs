# Policies

Here you will find information that describes Databrary's unique policy framework.
It allows researchers with formal authorization from their institutions to freely access identifiable and sensitive data shared by participants with other authorized researchers.

## Databrary Access Agreement (DAA)

The Databrary Access Agreement (DAA) is the formal, legally binding document that Institutions (and in some cases researchers) sign to give researchers access to Databrary.

The DAA has consists of a main document and three annexes:

- [Databrary Access Agreement (DAA)](../policies/daa-2020-06-10.md)

- [Annex I - Statement of Rights and Responsibilities](../policies/daa-annex-I-2020-06-10.md)

- [Annex II - Additional Authorized Investigators](../policies/daa-annex-II-2020-06-10.md)

- [Annex III - Databrary Access Guide](../policies/daa-annex-III-2020-06-10.md)

Once Databrary staff have received a signed copy of the DAA from an institutional official, the researcher becomes a Databrary Authorized Investigator.

## [Data Sharing Manifesto](dataSharingManifesto.md)

- Databrary's primary purpose is to foster open data-sharing among a community of researchers in developmental science in particular, and in psychological and neural science more generally.
- Open data-sharing is entirely voluntary. Investigators choose whether to share, when to share, and what to share. Databrary hopes that most Investigators will choose to share, will share early on in the research process, and will share most or all of the information they have permission to share. But, there is no requirement to do so.
- Some models for when to share are as follows:
  - At the end of the formal grant period of a federally funded project.
  - Within one year of the date an article is accepted for publication or appears (online or in print).
  - When an article is accepted for publication.
  - At the time of submission of an article for peer review.
- The more investigators who share and the more information they share, the more the community of researchers will benefit, the more scientists will discover, and the more the public will benefit.
- Investigators who use information shared by others should follow ethical principles.
  - They should cite resources contributed by other Investigators. Citation is an important currency of scholarly activity.
  - They should contribute data and analyses of their own to Databrary in a timely way. Not everyone has the resources to collect highly valuable data sets. But, secondary analyses of data sets should be shared and linked to their original sources.
  - Investigators who use datasets contributed by others should consider contacting the data contributor when embarking on a new analysis of a contributed data set. It may also be appropriate to invite the data contributor to collaborate.
- Databrary encourages data from unpublished studies to be shared. In fact, Databrary provides an excellent home for them.

## Data security

Data and metadata stored in Databrary are subject to the security policies and best practices implemented by NYU.
For more information about these policies and services, please visit NYU ITS Computer & Network Security at <http://www.nyu.edu/its/security/.>

Databrary requires all Databrary Authorized Investigators and Supervised Users to embrace best practices for data security.

### Protect Confidentiality  

Databrary contains identifying information, thus special care must be taken.  

- Participants should be identified by a code that does not include names, initials, birthdates, phone or ID numbers, etc.  
- Identifying information should be removed from text/flat files before it is shared with Databrary.
  -If you collect sensitive information on paper, lock the paper records in file cabinets and ensure that the file cabinets are located in locked rooms that are not readily accessible to unauthorized people.  
  
### Password Generation  

- Use a unique password or passphrase for Databrary.  
- Do not share your password with others.  
- Choose a password that has capital and lower case letters, special characters and numbers and is long, greater than 10-12 characters.  
- Do not write your password down.  
- Do not store your password in an unencrypted file on your computer.  
- Change your password at least every 6 months.  
  
### Computers Used to Access and Download Databrary files  

- Computers should have individual-level, password-protected user accounts.  
- Computer account IDs or passwords should not be shared.  
- Computer account passwords should differ from those used for Databrary (see above).  
- Laptops may be stolen or lost, so it may be wise to enable system-wide file encryption.  
- Set your computer to activate a password protected screen saver after 3 minutes of inactivity.  
- Disable automatic log-in.  
- Set your computer to automatically logout after 5 minutes of inactivity.  
- Databrary logs the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of computers that access the system, so you may wish to choose a specific computer or computers to use to access Databrary.  
  
### Data File Storage and Backup  

- If flat-file data are stored on laboratory computers, those computers should be regularly (daily or weekly) backed up to a secure location offsite.
- More than one backup copy should exist. All backups should be secure.  
- Since Databrary stores high resolution copies of recordings that can be downloaded at any time, recordings taken from Databrary need not be backed up. Indeed, creating multiple backups of recordings from Databrary increases the risk that sensitive information may be released inadvertently.  

### Physical features of laboratory or office

- Laboratories or offices that house computers where data are stored should be locked whenever the rooms are unoccupied.  
- Laboratories or offices that house computers where data are stored should not be readily accessible to unauthorized people who are not supervised by a researcher.  
- Be aware of whether the layout of your laboratory or office inadvertently allows other individuals to see your computer screen or reflections from your computer screen through doors or windows.
