# Guide for Institutions

Welcome to Databrary's guide for institutions.
Institutions play important roles in the Databrary system.
This page describes some of them.

Users who wish to gain access to restricted/non-public content on Databrary must secure formal authorization from an Institution.
The [Databrary Access Agreement (DAA)](daa.md) and its three Annexes formalize that approval.
The DAA grants user and contributor privileges to all shared data in Databrary.
Once the agreement is finalized, Authorized Investigators can access identifiable data that is shared.

::: tip NOTE
Approval for research involving human subjects is **not** required by Databrary in order to become an Authorized Investigator.
However, research ethics review **may** be required by an Institution.
:::

Typically, contributing data and conducting research using Databrary resources require institutional approval for research involving human subjects.
However, many uses of Databrary are for pre-research or non-research purposes (e.g. browsing data for ideas, getting video clips for teaching or talks, learning about procedures or methods) and do not typically require institutional approval for research involving human subjects.

## Types of Institutions

As an academic research data library, Databrary based at New York University, Databrary's users come from similar Institutions--academic, research, government, or health entities.
Institutions eligible to sign the Databrary Access Agreement must

**COPY LANGUAGE FROM DAA**

- Maintain or use an ethics board or Institutional Review Board with U.S.-equivalent standards that reviews and approves research involving human subjects,
- Maintains or uses a research ethics board or Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee with U.S.-equivalent standards to review and approve research involving non-human subjects
- research ethics board or Institutional Review Board (IRB) and has standards equivalent to that required to secure Federalwide Assurance (FWA) status from the U.S. Government (see: <https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/index.html).>

## For officials with signing authority

Researchers seeking authorization to access Databrary must have their DAA approved and signed by an an official representative of the Institution, i.e, a person with legal authority to sign and enter into contracts on behalf of the Institution.
In colleges and universities in the U.S., a person with this responsibility is often called an authorized organizational representative (AOR).

The AOR can be from different departments depending on the institutional structure. In the United States, it is often the Office of Sponsored Programs, Grants and Contracts Offices or Vice President of Research.
In European countries, we often work with the Provost of Research or Vice Chancellorâ€™s office. In some cases the Head of School is an authorized signatory.

Once an institution's AOR or the equivalent has signed the DAA and returned it to Databrary, the individual becomes an Authorized Investigator.

When Authorizing Investigators

The institution confirms the eligibility of its investigators by:

Verifying that authorized investigators are eligible to conduct independent research at the institution.
Validating that authorized investigators have research ethics training that meets the institution's standards.
The institution:

Maintains an ethics or institutional review board that reviews and approves research involving human subjects.
Grants authorized investigators the responsibility to choose and manage affiliates who meet Databrary's qualifications and who agree to follow Databrary's ethical principles. The institution holds authorized investigators responsible for the conduct of affiliates they select.
Accepts responsibility for its authorized investigator(s) actions related to the use of Databrary.
Data Contribution and Use
The institution:

Asserts that it has the rights to share with Databrary any data the authorized investigator contributes; no other entity or individual has ownership rights that prevent the authorized investigator from contributing data to Databrary.
Agrees to allow use of the data exclusively for the purpose of scientific research or education under the auspices of an academic, research, government, health, or commercial entity (but in the last case, solely for non-commercial purposes unless allowed under the terms of a separate agreement).
Agrees not to sell or trade data or use it for other commercial purposes.
Grants each authorized investigator authority to decide when and with whom the authorized investigator wishes to share data, and the institution holds the authorized investigator responsible for the use of shared data.
Agrees to follow all relevant national, state, and local laws and regulations that pertain to the use of research data.

Confidentiality and Ethics

The institution agrees to inform Databrary of any suspected violation of confidentiality or ethics. If Databrary determines that an authorized investigator at the institution has violated the terms of the Databrary Access Agreement or other Databrary policies, Databrary may remove the data in question and/or deny the authorized investigator or the institution access to Databrary, temporarily or permanently.

Any violation may be reported to the official at the institution charged with handling violations of research ethics. The Institution may request information from Databrary about the authorized investigator's use or their Affiliate's use of the library.

If denied access to Databrary, authorized investigators or the institution may request a review.

Each party shall be responsible for its negligent acts or omissions and the negligent acts or omissions of its employees, officers, or director's, to the extent allowed by law.

## For Ethics Boards and IRBs

Ethics and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) have important roles to play in protecting research participants whose data are stored and shared on Databrary.
This section...

## Rules for Ethics oversight vs. approval
  
The Databrary Access Agreement is different from a traditional Data Use Agreement because there is no obligation for authorized investigators to use or to contribute data. Once our researchers are planning to share data from lab or repurpose shared data in a systematic way, they would seek proper IRB approval for those activities.

Here are our guidelines regarding ethics board involvement:

Ethics board **oversight is required** to join Databrary. In other words, your institution must have an IRB or human subjects research ethics board (REB).

Ethics board **approval is NOT required**:

- for access to Databrary. In other words, just to browse.

- to contribute data to Databrary that does not contain personally identifying information (PII). In other words, procedural videos, stims, coding files, analysis, computer codes, etc.

Ethics board **approval IS required**:

- to re-use data from Databrary. In other words, to conduct secondary data analyses.

- to contribute data to Databrary that contains personally identifying information (PII). In other words, videos containing participant faces, names, dates of birth, etc.
  
## Working with your IRB

Some researchers view IRB concerns as an impediment to data sharing, even those researchers who understand the many benefits of sharing. Given the checkered history of psychological science with regard to respecting the rights of human participants, it is not surprising that not sharing data has been a generally acceptable practice. However, IRB concerns and recommendations around data sharing vary depending on the specific type of data being shared. Moreover, best practices for seeking informed consent are widely available, thereby properly protecting participants.

### Types of Data Sharing

Different types and levels of data sharing are associated with different ethical concerns. It is useful to distinguish among different use cases, and the types of concerns raised around data sharing in developmental science.

### Data reuse

Using data shared by others ("secondary use") usually involves low risk to participants because the new study does not involve contact with the participants. However, the level of risk depends on the nature of the data, whether the data are identifiable or otherwise sensitive, and the sort of permission that participants initially granted for sharing. Reuse of existing shared data is common practice, so most IRBs have established procedures for determining the level of risk posed by a particular project involving secondary use. For example, many IRBs deem exempt from review projects that involve the secondary use of non-sensitive, de-identified data.

### Video data and other data that might contain identifiers

What's new, less common, and a potential source of concern to IRBs is the push by investigators under their supervision for more widespread sharing of certain types of data.
This push means that PIs and their IRBs must evaluate the risks of sharing data within each particular study. Doing so requires determining what data can be shared, with whom and how, and with what level of risk.
The risk of identification raises special concern.
Fortunately, practices about what personal identifiers should be eliminated from data files are well established (even in brain imaging), so in many cases, de-identifying data files is uncomplicated.
In cases where researchers seek to share sensitive or identifiable data (such as unaltered video or audio recordings that might contain participants' faces, voices, or audible names), establishing guidelines on restriction of access is essential. Sharing these sorts of data increases risks to participants, and therefore explicit permission to share must be sought, with participants being fully informed of the meaning of "shared data" and who will have access.

### Who gets access and where

Choices about how PIs should share data and who should have access are complicated. PIs or IRBs may be under the mistaken impression that shared data should (or must) be publicly available to meet open science standards, or journal or funder mandates. In fact, some of the most successful examples of data sharing in developmental research involve restricted access, where data are stored in recognized data repositories that limit access to approved researchers. Public access may be appropriate for some datasets, but it should not be the standard to which all studies must be held.

## Solutions

It is critical to seek explicit permission from participants to share data and to be transparent about the uses of those data. This honors participants' autonomy by ensuring they (and/or their caregivers) fully understand the risks of sharing the data they contribute â€“ as well as the potential benefits to science and the community at large that they are granting by sharing.

### Capitalize on existing resources

Developmental science has a long history of data sharing, and researchers can learn best practices from existing resources.
In developing institution- or project-specific language for consents and data sharing permissions, PIs and IRBs can draw on the collective experience of experts and data repositories that have experience sharing data from vulnerable populations, such as children. Sources that provide valuable guidance about how to seek informed consent and data sharing permission, including template language, include:

- [Databrary](https://www.databrary.org/resources/policies.html);
- Child Language Data Exchange System [(CHILDES)](https://talkbank.org/share/irb/);
- Inter-university Consortium on Political and Social Research [(ICPSR)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/datamanagement/confidentiality/conf-language.html); and
- [Open Brain Consent](https://open-brain-consent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project.
  
Several of these organizations are collaborating on developing template language and data sharing procedures that will make these provisions even more consistent in the future.

Be ready with answers to IRB questions about data reuse.

The IRB review plays a vital role in ensuring that standard consent, data management, and data sharing practices used for primary data collection enable future secondary uses while minimizing the risks to the original participants. Anticipating the questions that will be raised by IRBs and knowing how best to respond will enhance the likelihood of your IRB granting permission for data sharing. For example, in reviewing data sharing plans, IRBs may raise several practical questions that require an explicit response. For example:

Q. Must minors be re-consented when they reach the age of majority?

A. Federal officials say not if re-consenting is impractical or otherwise increases risks to participants (e.g., by requiring researchers to maintain links between identifiable information and collected data for extended time periods).

Q. Must data be destroyed after a particular time period?

A. Not if they are stored indefinitely in a recognized repository (as should become standard practice); data destruction is not mandated under federal regulations.

Request participant consent for sharing after their participation is complete.
Because IRBs are concerned with participants being fully aware of what they are sharing, it is best practice to request participants' consent to share after they have participated in a study, and therefore know exactly what data were gathered. Most developmental research is innocuous, and most parents are willing to share their children's data â€“ including video recordings â€“ after they see that the project was fun and their children enjoyed participating. Most parents of children with disabilities are willing to share their children's data because they hope to speed progress in research.
