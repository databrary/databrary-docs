# Guide for Institutions

Welcome to Databrary's guide for institutions.
Institutions play important roles in the Databrary system.
This page describes some of them.

Users who wish to gain access to restricted/non-public content on Databrary must secure formal authorization from an Institution.
The [Databrary Access Agreement (DAA)](daa.md) and its three Annexes formalize that approval.
The DAA grants user and contributor privileges to all shared data in Databrary.
Once the agreement is finalized, Authorized Investigators can access identifiable data that is shared.

::: tip NOTE
Approval for research involving human subjects is **not** required by Databrary in order to become an Authorized Investigator.
However, research ethics review **may** be required by an Institution.
:::

Typically, contributing data and conducting research using Databrary resources require institutional approval for research involving human subjects.
However, many uses of Databrary are for pre-research or non-research purposes (e.g. browsing data for ideas, getting video clips for teaching or talks, learning about procedures or methods) and do not typically require institutional approval for research involving human subjects.

## Types of Institutions Eligible

As an academic research data library, Databrary based at New York University (NYU), Databrary's users come from similar Institutions--academic, research, government, or health entities.
Institutions eligible to sign the Databrary Access Agreement must

COPY LANGUAGE FROM DAA

- Maintain or use an ethics board or Institutional Review Board with U.S.-equivalent standards that reviews and approves research involving human subjects,
- Maintains or uses a research ethics board or Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee with U.S.-equivalent standards to review and approve research involving non-human subjects
- research ethics board or Institutional Review Board (IRB) and has standards equivalent to that required to secure Federalwide Assurance (FWA) status from the U.S. Government (see: <https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/index.html).>

## For Institutions

### What is Databrary

Databrary is a restricted access, web-based data library housed at New
York University.
Databrary is designed for sharing identifiable or
sensitive research data, including video files and associated metadata.
Authorized Investigators approved by their institutions for access to
Databrary may access data shared by others and/or contribute data for
others to access.
Databrary requires that an Authorized Investigator
secure institutional approval, usually from a research ethics board,
before contributing personally identifiable human or non-human animal
data to Databrary or conducting research on any data obtained from
others through Databrary.
Databrary, however, does not require
institutional approval for permitted non-research uses (e.g.,
pre-research, preliminary analysis, self-study, teaching) beyond this
Databrary Access Agreement.

All institutions and Authorized Investigators agree to use Databrary and
data obtained through it exclusively for the purpose of non-commercial
scientific research or education.

Databrary is supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the
U.S. National Science Foundation, DARPA, and private foundations.

### How Databrary differs from other data repositories

Databrary has several features that distinguish it from other data
repositories:

- A single binding agreement between NYU/Databrary and a researcher's institution (Databrary Access Agreement) permits both data use and contribution.

- Researchers granted institutional authorization to access Databrary may use data shared by other Authorized Investigators without having to secure (i) additional permission from the data contributor or (ii) approval from Databrary.

- Databrary requires that Authorized Investigators (i) secure all necessary institutional approvals to upload data to the site and (ii) secure explicit data sharing permission from human participants.

- Institutions take responsibility for authorizing researchers and reviewing and monitoring their research and non-research activities involving Databrary.

- Researchers take responsibility for securing required approvals from the institution and sharing permission from research participants, for protecting data, and for selecting, training, and managing access to restricted data by their staff, students, trainees, and others.

### Data security, integrity, and preservation

Data and metadata stored on Databrary are subject to the security
policies and best practices implemented by NYU. For more information
about these policies and services, visit NYU ITS Computer & Network
Security at <http://www.nyu.edu/its/security/>.

Data stored on Databrary will be preserved indefinitely in a secure data
storage facility at New York University (NYU). The facility is managed
by the university's Information Technology Services department. Central
IT staff handle storage, network, and backup systems. NYU does routine
tape backups that are stored off-site and performs regular file fixity
checks to monitor the integrity of stored assets.

Files uploaded to Databrary are assigned a unique identifier and have
metadata associating them to files that are uploaded to replace them.
Though only the latest version of a file is typically exposed to
Databrary site users. Files, once uploaded, are never deleted.

### For officials with signature authority

Some materials on Databrary are available to the public. but access to
most data requires that a researcher secure formal written authorization
from an institution. The Databrary Access Agreement (DAA) is the legally
binding document that formalizes the authorization process.

#### The Databrary Access Agreement permits data use and data contribution

The Databrary Access Agreement combines provisions for data use and data
contribution. Unlike data use agreements that allow specific individuals
access to a particular dataset for a discrete research purpose, the
Databrary Access Agreement allows Authorized Investigators to access all
shared datasets on Databrary and to use the datasets for many different
institutionally-approved purposes. In addition, the Databrary Access
Agreement permits Authorized Investigators to upload data and to share
it with other Authorized Investigators in accord with the sharing
permissions granted by participants and any required institutional
approvals. Databrary believes that combining data use and data
contribution in a single agreement reduces barriers to data sharing,
meets emerging funder mandates to share research data, and accelerates
progress in research.

#### Applying for Institutional Authorization

Individuals who are eligible to conduct independent research, submit
funding proposals as the lead investigator, have Principal Investigator
(PI) status, or have tenure-track faculty positions at their
institution, may apply to their institution for approval to be named an
Authorized Investigator. To receive authorization a person must apply
for and receive authorization from their institution; Databrary does not
grant authorization separate from an institution. In the U.S., a college
or university\'s grants and contracts or sponsored programs office
usually takes responsibility for granting authorization by signing the
Databrary Access Agreement. Databrary staff will work with a researcher
and an institution to secure signatures on the Databrary Access
Agreement. The authorization process typically takes a few days to a few
weeks.

#### When Authorized Investigators leave an Institution

Authorized Investigators are expected to inform Databrary when they
leave an institution. Institutions may also inform Databrary.

Access to non-public data shared with other Authorized Investigators
will be suspended when an Authorized Investigator leaves their
institution. The suspension extends to an Authorized Investigators'
Affiliates. Authorized Investigators will continue to have
password-protected access to data they uploaded to Databrary after they
leave an institution. When a new institution grants authorization,
Authorized Investigators will regain access to non-public data shared by
other Authorized Investigators.

If an Authorized Investigator retires, is incapacitated due to illness,
or dies, the institution should inform Databrary so that the Authorized
Investigator's account may be suspended. An institution may choose to
designate a data steward for the Authorized Investigator's data and
authorize that person to manage access to the data. If the institution
does not identify and authorize a data steward, Databrary staff will
serve that role. However, the Databrary staff serving as data steward
will not change the data sharing status of any specific dataset without
explicit written guidance from the institution.

#### Selecting Affiliates

If permitted by their institution, an Authorized Investigator may grant
a person outside their institution Affiliate status. Institutions may
establish policies governing the selection and management of Affiliates
by their Authorized Investigators.

If a person is eligible to be an Authorized Investigator at their home
institution, that person must apply for access to Databrary through
their home institution. Except in unusual circumstances, researchers
eligible to be Authorized Investigators at their home institution should
not be granted access to Databrary as the Affiliate of another
Authorized Investigator either from the same institution or a different
one. Databrary welcomes questions about these policies at
<contact@databrary.org>.

### For research ethics boards

#### Video\'s use cases extend beyond research

In addition to its many uses in research, video may be used for a
variety of pre-research and non-research uses, such as the documentation
of methodological details, the demonstration of computer-based tasks, or
the showing of video clips for teaching or scientific presentations.
Databrary encourages the storage and sharing of video for all of these
purposes, in a manner consistent with participant permissions and
institutional approvals.

#### Institutions determine when research ethics board or IRB approval is necessary

Databrary does not require prior research ethics board or IRB approval
for an Authorized Investigator to be granted access to the system or to
use Databrary\'s shared resources for non-research, educational, or
pre-research uses. However, in signing the Databrary Access Agreement,
all Authorized Investigators promise to secure research ethics approval
whenever their use of Databrary requires it under the institution\'s
policies.

Non-research, educational, or pre-research use cases may not require
research ethics board or IRB review and approval at every institution.
Institutions decide which use cases require research ethics board or IRB
review and approval.

#### What data are shared

Databrary contains images, video, and audio recordings that may be
identifiable, data and metadata that are not typically sensitive, and
de-identified data. Exact birth dates may be stored for use in
calculating exact ages, but exact birth dates are only exposed to
Authorized Investigators or Affiliates. Names, addresses, email
addresses, financial information, government ID numbers, detailed
geographic location information, and other personally identifiable data
elements are **not** stored and shared on Databrary.

#### Securing permission to share

To contribute and share identifiable data with Databrary, Authorized
Investigators must secure permission to store the recordings on
Databrary from research participants and any other people (e.g.,
research staff) who are recorded.

Databrary developed a Sharing Release Template that informs people
depicted in recordings of the potential risks associated with sharing
video and other data on Databrary. The Sharing Release Template is one
of the resources Databrary makes available to researchers. The Sharing
Release Template may be adapted for use at any institution and added to
any research ethics or IRB protocol. However, an institution may require
other release language to provide equivalent protections.

Whether de-identified or pseudonymized data may be shared with Databrary
without seeking explicit permission from research participants depends
on the Authorized Investigator\'s institution. Some ethics boards or
IRBs may allow de-identified or pseudonymized data to be shared without
the explicit permission of the research participant.

#### Uploading data and assigning sharing permission levels

Authorized Investigators who upload data to Databrary must assign to
each file the level of data sharing granted by research
participants---from none to public access. The sharing level assigned to
each file by default is *Private*, meaning that no person other than the
Authorized Investigator who uploaded the file and any Affiliates granted
access by the Authorized Investigator, may view the file.

Not only are data files assigned a *Private* sharing level by default,
but all newly created datasets are initially made *Private*, accessible
only to an Authorized Investigator, any Affiliates the Authorized
Investigator selects, and any other individual Authorized Investigators
granted specific access to the dataset. An Authorized Investigator may
elect to create an overview of a dataset when it is created and make the
overview publicly available. The overview can serve as the public face
of the dataset while the dataset is being collected and analyzed. This
can be useful in documenting progress on a research grant to sponsors.
The dataset overview does not expose data unless the Authorized
Investigator chooses to do so.

#### Sharing data

At a time when the Authorized Investigator chooses---e.g., when a paper
goes to press or a grant period ends---the Authorized Investigator may
choose to share the dataset with other Authorized Investigators on
Databrary. This makes the data contained in the dataset available to
other Authorized Investigators and possibly the public, but only in
accordance with the sharing levels selected by Authorized Investigators
and always subject to the permission granted by participants. That is,
individual data files marked *Private* remain accessible only to people
the Authorized Investigator specifically selects. Similarly, access to
datasets labeled *Private* remains solely under the control of the
Authorized Investigator.

#### Databrary and GDPR

Authorized Investigators may collect personal data from research
participants who have rights under the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). GDPR governs the collection of personal data in the
European Economic Area (EEA).

Databrary\'s servers are currently located in the United States, and
data stored on Databrary may be accessed, downloaded, and reused by
Authorized Investigators and their Affiliates located outside of the
EEA. Hundreds of institutions across the globe have signed the Databrary
Access Agreement. Databrary maintains a list of Authorized Investigators
who have access to shared research data at
<https://nyu.databrary.org/search?volume=false&f.party_authorization=4&f.party_is_institution=false>.

In seeking permission to collect data from research participants
governed by GDPR or similar provisions, Authorized Investigators should
communicate to research participants information about who may have
access to shared data on Databrary and where the data are stored.
Institutions and Authorized Investigators assume responsibility for
ensuring that research participants give sharing data permission that
satisfies the provisions of GDPR and for abiding by other provisions of
GDPR.

Databrary does not typically store information that links a person\'s
identity to specific files unless there is a separate agreement between
the Authorized Investigator, the institution, and Databrary to store
this type of data. Therefore, if a research participant requests a copy
of data stored on Databrary or the modification or deletion of personal
data that is stored on Databrary, the Authorized Investigator or
institution is responsible for responding to the request, not Databrary.
Also, Databrary cannot guarantee that data previously shared with other
Authorized Investigators via Databrary can be retrieved from all
Authorized Investigators who accessed a participant\'s personal data
prior to its modification or removal. Thus, Authorized Investigators
should communicate to research participants that there are limits to a
participant\'s right to modify or delete personal data that have already
been shared on Databrary. The Databrary Release Template contains
language for this purpose.

When accessing data shared by other Authorized Investigators,
institutions and their Authorized Investigators assume responsibility
for ensuring that the sharing permission research participants have
given in other contexts outside of the EEA meet relevant GDPR
provisions.

## For Research Ethics and Institutional Review Boards

Research Ethics and Institutional Review Boards (REBs and IRBs) have important roles to play in protecting research participants whose data are stored and shared on Databrary.
This section...

## Rules for ethics oversight vs. approval
  
The Databrary Access Agreement is different from a traditional Data Use Agreement because there is no obligation for authorized investigators to use or to contribute data. Once our researchers are planning to share data from lab or repurpose shared data in a systematic way, they would seek proper IRB approval for those activities.

Here are our guidelines regarding ethics board involvement:

Ethics board **oversight is required** to join Databrary. In other words, your institution must have an IRB or human subjects research ethics board (REB).

Ethics board **approval is NOT required**:

- for access to Databrary. In other words, just to browse.

- to contribute data to Databrary that does not contain personally identifying information (PII). In other words, procedural videos, stims, coding files, analysis, computer codes, etc.

Ethics board **approval IS required**:

- to re-use data from Databrary. In other words, to conduct secondary data analyses.

- to contribute data to Databrary that contains personally identifying information (PII). In other words, videos containing participant faces, names, dates of birth, etc.
  
## Working with your IRB

Some researchers view IRB concerns as an impediment to data sharing, even those researchers who understand the many benefits of sharing. Given the checkered history of psychological science with regard to respecting the rights of human participants, it is not surprising that not sharing data has been a generally acceptable practice. However, IRB concerns and recommendations around data sharing vary depending on the specific type of data being shared. Moreover, best practices for seeking informed consent are widely available, thereby properly protecting participants.

### Types of Data Sharing

Different types and levels of data sharing are associated with different ethical concerns. It is useful to distinguish among different use cases, and the types of concerns raised around data sharing in developmental science.

### Data reuse

Using data shared by others ("secondary use") usually involves low risk to participants because the new study does not involve contact with the participants. However, the level of risk depends on the nature of the data, whether the data are identifiable or otherwise sensitive, and the sort of permission that participants initially granted for sharing. Reuse of existing shared data is common practice, so most IRBs have established procedures for determining the level of risk posed by a particular project involving secondary use. For example, many IRBs deem exempt from review projects that involve the secondary use of non-sensitive, de-identified data.

### Video data and other data that might contain identifiers

What's new, less common, and a potential source of concern to IRBs is the push by investigators under their supervision for more widespread sharing of certain types of data.
This push means that PIs and their IRBs must evaluate the risks of sharing data within each particular study. Doing so requires determining what data can be shared, with whom and how, and with what level of risk.
The risk of identification raises special concern.
Fortunately, practices about what personal identifiers should be eliminated from data files are well established (even in brain imaging), so in many cases, de-identifying data files is uncomplicated.
In cases where researchers seek to share sensitive or identifiable data (such as unaltered video or audio recordings that might contain participants' faces, voices, or audible names), establishing guidelines on restriction of access is essential. Sharing these sorts of data increases risks to participants, and therefore explicit permission to share must be sought, with participants being fully informed of the meaning of "shared data" and who will have access.

### Who gets access and where

Choices about how PIs should share data and who should have access are complicated. PIs or IRBs may be under the mistaken impression that shared data should (or must) be publicly available to meet open science standards, or journal or funder mandates. In fact, some of the most successful examples of data sharing in developmental research involve restricted access, where data are stored in recognized data repositories that limit access to approved researchers. Public access may be appropriate for some datasets, but it should not be the standard to which all studies must be held.

## Solutions

It is critical to seek explicit permission from participants to share data and to be transparent about the uses of those data. This honors participants' autonomy by ensuring they (and/or their caregivers) fully understand the risks of sharing the data they contribute – as well as the potential benefits to science and the community at large that they are granting by sharing.

### Capitalize on existing resources

Developmental science has a long history of data sharing, and researchers can learn best practices from existing resources.
In developing institution- or project-specific language for consents and data sharing permissions, PIs and IRBs can draw on the collective experience of experts and data repositories that have experience sharing data from vulnerable populations, such as children. Sources that provide valuable guidance about how to seek informed consent and data sharing permission, including template language, include:

- [Databrary](https://www.databrary.org/resources/policies.html);
- Child Language Data Exchange System [(CHILDES)](https://talkbank.org/share/irb/);
- Inter-university Consortium on Political and Social Research [(ICPSR)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/datamanagement/confidentiality/conf-language.html); and
- [Open Brain Consent](https://open-brain-consent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project.
  
Several of these organizations are collaborating on developing template language and data sharing procedures that will make these provisions even more consistent in the future.

Be ready with answers to IRB questions about data reuse.

The IRB review plays a vital role in ensuring that standard consent, data management, and data sharing practices used for primary data collection enable future secondary uses while minimizing the risks to the original participants. Anticipating the questions that will be raised by IRBs and knowing how best to respond will enhance the likelihood of your IRB granting permission for data sharing. For example, in reviewing data sharing plans, IRBs may raise several practical questions that require an explicit response. For example:

Q. Must minors be re-consented when they reach the age of majority?

A. Federal officials say not if re-consenting is impractical or otherwise increases risks to participants (e.g., by requiring researchers to maintain links between identifiable information and collected data for extended time periods).

Q. Must data be destroyed after a particular time period?

A. Not if they are stored indefinitely in a recognized repository (as should become standard practice); data destruction is not mandated under federal regulations.

Request participant consent for sharing after their participation is complete.
Because IRBs are concerned with participants being fully aware of what they are sharing, it is best practice to request participants' consent to share after they have participated in a study, and therefore know exactly what data were gathered. Most developmental research is innocuous, and most parents are willing to share their children's data – including video recordings – after they see that the project was fun and their children enjoyed participating. Most parents of children with disabilities are willing to share their children's data because they hope to speed progress in research.

## For officials with signing authority

Researchers seeking authorization to access Databrary must have their DAA approved and signed by an an official representative of the Institution, i.e, a person with legal authority to sign and enter into contracts on behalf of the Institution.
In colleges and universities in the U.S., a person with this responsibility is often called an authorized organizational representative (AOR).

The AOR can be from different departments depending on the institutional structure. In the United States, it is often the Office of Sponsored Programs, Grants and Contracts Offices or Vice President of Research.
In European countries, we often work with the Provost of Research or Vice Chancellor’s office. In some cases the Head of School is an authorized signatory.

Once an institution's AOR or the equivalent has signed the DAA and returned it to Databrary, the individual becomes an Authorized Investigator.

Accepts responsibility for its authorized investigator(s) actions related to the use of Databrary.
Data Contribution and Use
The institution:

Asserts that it has the rights to share with Databrary any data the authorized investigator contributes; no other entity or individual has ownership rights that prevent the authorized investigator from contributing data to Databrary.
Agrees to allow use of the data exclusively for the purpose of scientific research or education under the auspices of an academic, research, government, health, or commercial entity (but in the last case, solely for non-commercial purposes unless allowed under the terms of a separate agreement).
Agrees not to sell or trade data or use it for other commercial purposes.
Grants each authorized investigator authority to decide when and with whom the authorized investigator wishes to share data, and the institution holds the authorized investigator responsible for the use of shared data.
Agrees to follow all relevant national, state, and local laws and regulations that pertain to the use of research data.

Confidentiality and Ethics

The institution agrees to inform Databrary of any suspected violation of confidentiality or ethics. If Databrary determines that an authorized investigator at the institution has violated the terms of the Databrary Access Agreement or other Databrary policies, Databrary may remove the data in question and/or deny the authorized investigator or the institution access to Databrary, temporarily or permanently.

Any violation may be reported to the official at the institution charged with handling violations of research ethics. The Institution may request information from Databrary about the authorized investigator's use or their Affiliate's use of the library.

If denied access to Databrary, authorized investigators or the institution may request a review.

Each party shall be responsible for its negligent acts or omissions and the negligent acts or omissions of its employees, officers, or director's, to the extent allowed by law.
