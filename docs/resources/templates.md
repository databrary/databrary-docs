# Templates

Databrary has created a number of template documents, sample scripts, and videos that researchers can use as they see fit.

## Securing permission to share

In order to share identifiable data on Databrary Authorized Investigators must secure permission from the people depicted in recordings or images.
Databrary calls this data sharing permission a "release" since it involves releasing data for use by other researchers.
Databrary recommends adapting the [Databrary Sharing Release Template](release-template.md) although the exact Databrary Sharing Release Template language is not required.
The Databrary Release Template serves as a guideline.

::: tip NOTE
The ethics board or IRB must determine what specific language should be used for securing data sharing permission and whether requesting permission to share data should be part of the research consent process or separate from it.
:::

Whatever language and permission process the Institution requires should allow the Authorized Investigator to determine clearly what level of sharing release participants have granted.

### Sharing release templates

- [Sharing release template for parent of child or adult participants](release-template.md)

::: tip NOTE
Since research staff may be depicted in images or recordings, their permission should also be sought.
:::

Here is a form for securing that permisson from research staff:

- [Sharing release for research staff](staff-release.md)

### Sample release script

> Now that you have finished this session, there's one more thing we want to ask you. The data that researchers collect from babies and families are incredibly valuable for helping scientists to understand how children develop.
> So we wanted to ask if you are comfortable with allowing us to share the data we collected from this session with other researchers just like the professor who runs this lab/project. The data would be shared in a secure, online library, it's not available to the public-- only researchers that are authorized by their University would be able to access the information in the library.
> This permission form also asks whether you would allow other professors/ researchers like Dr. [PIâ€™s Name] to show short bits of the videos to students or researchers for educational and scientific purposes. These data will not be used or shown for commercial purposes.

### Video examples

Here are videos that show how a researcher may ask a parent permission to share data:

## Working with your ethics board or IRB

Databrary has developed boilerplate language that researchers may use in applying for permission to use Databrary for research:

- [IRB application language](irb-application.md)

## Lab staff Access Agreement

Authorized Investigators may wish to have their laboratory staff (Affiliates) sign an agreement prior to granting them access to Databrary.
This template is modeled after the [Databrary Access Agreement](../policies/daa-2020-06-10.md).

- [Lab Staff Agreement](../policies/staff-agreement.md)

## Data management plan template

Here is a link to a Data Management Plan template you can adapt for your own grant proposals:

- [Data Management Plan template](data-management-plan.md)
