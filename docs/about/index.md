# About Databrary

Databrary is a restricted access data library for researchers who wish to store and share video and related data about human and non-human animal behavior.
Databrary is based at [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu) and at [Penn State](http://www.psu.edu).
The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) have provided funding. [Read more...](https://www.databrary.org/about/about-databrary.html)

Databrary is a web-based data library for developmental scientists to securely store, manage, share, discover, and reuse research data, including videos, audio files, procedures and stimuli, and related metadata. Databrary provides a secure and permanent repository for research data, backed by the resources of New York University's IT Department. In addition, Databrary has implemented a rigorous policy framework designed to permit the sharing and re-use of research data containing personally identifying information, with participant consent, in an ethical and efficient way. With a Databrary Access Agreement signed by their institution, researchers can re-use other scientists' data, improving reliability and transparency, and making data collection more cost effective. Researchers can also find illustrative video clips to use for teaching and conference presentations. Because Databrary provides persistent identifiers (DOIs) to shared datasets, researchers gain citation credit for their work. While there are other data repositories, Databrary is unique in allowing both uploading of research data as well as access to multiple datasets containing personally identifying information with one access agreement.

Databrary is specialized for the sharing of video data. Video (and audio) recordings may contain information about research participants or other individuals who are incidentally recorded. Images and/or voices may be visible or heard and names may be spoken out loud. If a study takes place in a home or other setting, aspects of that home or setting may be recorded. Thus, individuals or locations may be identified from recordings. In addition, metadata (e.g. child's birthdate) may contain identifiable information.

Databrary's policy framework, requiring participant consent, institutional approval, and ethics board oversight (see table below), creates a secure and ethical infrastructure for the sharing and re-use of research data containing personally identifying information. First, research data may only be shared on Databrary with explicit informed consent from each participant. Second, for researchers to gain access to Databrary's shared resources, their institution must execute a Databrary Access Agreement stipulating that the researcher: (a) belongs to an institution that maintains an ethics or Institutional Review Board with U.S.-equivalent standards that reviews and approves research involving human subjects; (b) has current research ethics training that addresses human subjects policy and issues; and (c) is eligible to conduct independent research at the institution. Third, investigators authorized to use Databrary agree to follow [strict policies designed to protect participant confidentiality](https://www.databrary.org/resources/policies/responsibilities/investigators.html), and must: (1) secure IRB/ethics board approval to ask participants for permission to share video on Databrary; (2) protect the identity of all individuals with information in Databrary, especially depicted individuals; (3) keep data secure on computers with limited access; (4) ensure that researchers in their lab who access data have applied for and been granted authorization to access Databrary; (5) respect the Release Level consented to by depicted individuals on shared data; (6) use resources from Databrary exclusively for the purpose of scientific research or education under the auspices of either an academic, research, government, health, or a commercial entity (but in the last case, solely for non-commercial purposes); and (7) cite all Databrary resources they use in their scholarly work.

This framework ensures maximal protection of participant confidentiality while simultaneous permitting data sharing amongst a community of scholars.
