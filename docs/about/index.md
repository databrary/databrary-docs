# About Databrary

Databrary is the world's only restricted access data library specialized for storing and sharing identifiable and sensitive research data, specifically video and audio recordings, associated with research on human and non-human animal behavior.
Video as research data and documentation has the potential to transform discovery in the behavioral sciences and make it more rigorous, robust, and reproducible.

Authorized Investigators approved by their institutions for access to Databrary may access data shared by others and/or contribute data for others to access.
Databrary requires that an Authorized Investigator secure institutional approval, usually from a research ethics board, before contributing personally identifiable human or non-human animal data to Databrary or conducting research on any data obtained from others through Databrary.
Databrary, however, does not require institutional approval for permitted non-research uses (e.g., pre-research, preliminary analysis, self-study, teaching) beyond the [Databrary Access Agreement](../policies/daa-2020-06-10.md)].

All institutions and Authorized Investigators agree to use Databrary and data obtained through it exclusively for the purpose of non-commercial scientific research or education.

Databrary is based at New York University.
